This zip file contains the EEE3032 Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Coursework written by Advaith Vellanki from the University of Surrey in November 2023.

The Basecode folder contains all of the Matlab code required to run the Visual Search System. 
The 'MSRC_ObjCategImageDatabase_v2' folder consists of the Microsoft Research MSRCv2 Database which is used in this coursework. 
The Descriptors folder contains all of the descriptors computed during this coursework from the image database.

Run the 'cvpr_computedescriptors' code to compute your descriptors and store them in a subfolder in the Descriptors folder. Different descriptors can be computed by selecting your choice inside the 'cvpr_computedescriptors' code.
Then run the 'cvpr_visualsearch' code to perform visual search of the database. The different descriptors and distance measures can be utilised inside the 'cvpr_visualsearch' code.
